HOW TO CONFIGURE THE DATABASE WHEN YOU IMPORT IT TO ANOTHER SERVER



STEP ONE

By default, the database containing the tables you want to import doesn't exist

so you have to create it 


--SQL SYNTAX

--CREATE THE DATABASE
CREATE DATABASE test_cbt;

STEP TWO
By default, the SQL doesn't know the database you want to use so you have to tell it

--SQL SYNTAX

--SELECT THE DATABASE YOU WANT
in this case, it is the database you just created above.
USE test_cbt


after this, save the .SQL file and reimport the file as a zip folder and it woudl import your database
